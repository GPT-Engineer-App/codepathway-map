# codepathway-map

I'm building a website that enables people tolearn coding and test their coding skills. The first page contains a diagram or something like a mental map with details about each unit and there's a little progress bar in each of those nodes together with the title.

You might need to use some good NPMP package enabling this functionality. Then, clicking on each of those would take you to another page where you can see all the units and tasks realted to this unit.

Let's start by implementing this initial homepage with the map. Pay attention to header, menu options there, footer and this central part.

Take your time to consider the image, break it down in components and let's build this.
